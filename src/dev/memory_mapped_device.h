/*
    Memory mapped devices

    Devices are mapped into blocks of 1KB (1024). This gives 64 blocks
    When the CPU reads or writes to memory, the address is divided by 1024 to get which block
    it needs to access.

    Some devices may share the same block, such as the keypad and the display. In this case we use
    a linked list. Everytime we map a device to a block, we check if the block's top-level device is empty (NULL)
    and if so, the device becomes the first device in the linked list. The next device will be added to the device's 'next' pointer.

    Everytime a read or write occurs, a call to the top-level device's is_mapped(address) is made, and if it returns false, it gets passed to the next
    device in the chain.
